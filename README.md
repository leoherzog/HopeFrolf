      <p>Site by <a href="http://agentl.productions">Agent L Productions</a></p>
      <p>This site is two things.</p>
      <p>One, it's basically just a playground for me to learn about Javascript, CSS, linux web hosting, and more.</p>
      <p>Two, it's to provide a service to the Hope College community and to document this important part of Hope College student life.</p>
      <p>Feel free to take a look at the source and adapt as you please.</p>
